# Markdown test

## Motivation

The motivation for this markdown file is to play around with the different types of markdown syntax.

One such syntax is to start a new paragraph, like we just did.  
This is different to a line break, which we just did there. We can play around with words too, making them **bold text** or as *itallic text*. There is also ***bold and itallics***.
