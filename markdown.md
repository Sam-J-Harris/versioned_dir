# Markdown test

## Motivation

The motivation for this markdown file is to play around with the different types of markdown syntax.

One such syntax is to start a new paragraph, like we just did.  
This is different to a line break, which we just did there. We can play around with words too, making them **bold text** or as *itallic text*. There is also ***bold and itallics***.

To list things, there are these options:

* Bullet listing, like this.
* There are also number lists, which we will do upcoming.

```
Brief pause while we put something in a box.
```

The next steps need to be achieved:  
1. Show an example of a number list.
1. Show how the number list updates the numbers itself.
1. Finish the number list.
